# Option-Pricing-Model
Option Pricing Models in Python This repository contains implementations of three fundamental option pricing models used in quantitative finance:

Black-Scholes Model A closed-form analytical solution for pricing European call and put options under the assumption of constant volatility and no early exercise.

Monte Carlo Simulation A numerical approach that estimates option prices by simulating multiple possible future stock price paths using stochastic processes and averaging discounted payoffs.

Binomial Option Pricing Model A discrete-time lattice model that approximates the price of European options by modeling possible price movements step-by-step back from expiration to the present.

Contents Each model is organized into its own folder containing:

Python implementation code

Sample output data files with calculated option prices

A detailed README with usage instructions and project overview

A project report explaining the theory, methodology, and results

Usage Requires Python with numpy and pandas installed.

Run the respective script to generate pricing outputs.

Review documentation and reports to understand each model's approach and limitations.

Purpose This project serves as a learning tool and demonstration of core option pricing techniques, suitable for self-study or educational reference.
